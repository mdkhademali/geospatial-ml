## Geospatial Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to analyze geospatial data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

## Features
1. Load and process geospatial data (Latitude/Longitude)
2. Train a machine learning model for classification
3. Visualize geospatial data using Matplotlib & Geopanda
4. Export trained models for predictions
